# StarDefenders
A fixed arcade space shooter game for Swift Playgrounds on iPadOS and macOS.

The story for this game has the player flying in a spaceship traveling through space and saw aliens 
attacking our star system near planet Earth. The objective of this game to help our player shoot the 
aliens away and save the star system from being destroyed. To play this game, the player touches the 
spaceship and drags it along the bottom part of the device screen. The bullets will automatically 
shoot, so the player will need to aim for the aliens. This playground uses three frameworks: 
SpriteKit, UIKit, and PlaygroundSupport. 

My playground was submitted to the Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge.
